# Galaxy Clustering with Unsupervised Learning

This project explores clustering galaxy populations from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation using multivariate statistical techniques. We focused on identifying meaningful groupings of galaxies based on their physical properties using Functional Data Analysis (FDA), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Hierarchical Clustering.

## Summary

- Used PCA to reduce dimensionality on high-dimensional astrophysical data
- Applied FDA techniques and then clustered the resulting curves
- Applied Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hierarchical Clustering to group galaxies
- Evaluated clustering results using silhouette scores and visualizations
- Discussed physical interpretation limits and future directions
- Data sourced from the public [IllustrisTNG project](https://www.tng-project.org)
